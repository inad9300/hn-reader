# Hacker News Reader

Lightweight reader for Hacker News written in vanilla JavaScript. It includes some
exciting features such as infinite scroll and offline support!

## Getting started
To run the application:
1. Install its dependencies with `npm install`.
2. Serve the files via [http-server](https://github.com/indexzero/http-server)
   by running `npm start`.
3. Access the URL indicated by the last command in a modern browser (by default,
   [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)).

## Potential future improvements
- Use a transpiler such as Babel to split the code into ES6 modules.
- Setup a build process capable of bundling and minifying.
- Improve offline capabilities, e.g. by managing old caches in case new versions
  are defined.
- Add automated tests!
